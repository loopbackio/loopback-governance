## Code of conduct

See LoopBack's [Governance
Principles](https://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Governance.html#principles):

> LoopBack is an open, inclusive, and tolerant community of people working
> together to build a world-class Node framework and tools. We value diversity
> of individuals and opinions, and seek to operate on consensus whenever
> possible. We strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free
> environment, regardless of the form of communication. When consensus is not
> achievable, we defer to the owners of each individual module; the powers of
> the individual owner are kept in check by the ability of the community to
> fork and replace dependencies on the individual module and maintainer.
