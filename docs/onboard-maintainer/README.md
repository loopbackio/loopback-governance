# Maintainer onboarding

- If you identify a community member who fits to be a LoopBack maintainer, go through the [nomination process](maintainer-nomination.md)
- Once approved, send an email to invite the community member to the maintainer team. [This email template for maintainer invitation](maintainer-invitation-template.md) can be used as a reference
- Once accepted, follow the steps in the [maintainer onboarding document](maintainer-onboarding.md)
