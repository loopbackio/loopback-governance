# Email template to invite potential maintainer


### Email subject

Invitation to join the team of LoopBack maintainers

### Email body

Hi _name_,

We really appreciate the work you have contributed to _repo_ and would like to invite you to join our team of LoopBack maintainers.


What would that mean for you:

- Greater influence on LoopBack's future direction

- Commit (write) rights to _repo_

- Ability to review and land pull requests, edit/categorize/close issues

- Access to a private Slack channel for LoopBack maintainers

If there is anything else that would make you a more successful maintainer, then let me know and I'll do my best to arrange it for you.

 
In return we ask you to follow the existing processes, see http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Governance.html. This means mostly:

- Be nice to others

- Try to reach consensus with other maintainers before making a decision

- Always use pull requests to make code changes

- Honour our current conventions, see http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/triaging-pull-requests.html and http://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/style-guide.html (but feel free to propose changes to these conventions!)

- To avoid possible confusion, we don't have any specific requirements about the amount of time you should spend on the project - just keep working on things that you find important to you, in a pace that suits you. We may ask you to take a look at issues and pull requests related to code you contributed yourself. This is primarily to make sure we don't accidentally break your stuff because of our lack of knowledge, and you can always excuse yourself :)

What do you think?
