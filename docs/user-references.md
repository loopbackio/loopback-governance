# User References

To show the community our users and their usage of LoopBack, we have been asking our users to reach out to us if they wish to have their companies showcased on our web site. 

## Where are the references

On the [LoopBack landing page](https://loopback.io/) under "Who's using LoopBack?" section, the logos of the companies which are using LoopBack will be highlighted there. 

Optionally, users can write a short paragraph about their experience with LoopBack and it will be listed in the ["What our users say" page](https://loopback.io/what-our-users-say.html).

## What should I do if I'm interested to have my company showcased? 

Submit a PR in [loopback.io repo](https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback.io):
1. add a high resolution company logo under [`images/users` folder](https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback.io/tree/gh-pages/images/users). It's recommended that the image is in png format. 
2. edit the "Who's using LoopBack?" section in [`index.html` file](https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback.io/blob/gh-pages/index.html). 
3. Optionally, a short paragraph in [`what-our-users-say.html` file](https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback.io/blob/gh-pages/what-our-users-say.html) about the usage and experience, together with the user's name, title and company. You might want to take a look at [this page](https://loopback.io/what-our-users-say.html) for inspiration and format. 

## As a maintainer, what should I do to review the PR?

Besides the regular review activity (make sure the pages are displaying properly, check for typo, etc), it would be good for maintainers to do some due dilligence for verification, though it is usually hard to validate whether the highlighted products are using LoopBack.
